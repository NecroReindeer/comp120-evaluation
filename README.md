#Weekly Reflective Report

##Week 1
Induction and settling in sessions. There wasn't really any sessions where we were taught things, so I don't really have anything to reflect on... We were introduced to LaTeX this week; however, I was already familiar with LaTeX from my prior Open University studies.

##Week 2
I initially struggled with SpaceChem, finding it difficult to develop working solutions.   
After being stuck on one particular level for a while, I realised that the reason I was failing to make progress was the fact that I was reluctant to take different approaches due to being unable to easily revert back to a previous solution. I decided to take a screenshot, making me feel more comfortable about starting the solution from scratch and resulting in me solving it almost immediately afterwards. This highlights one of the advantages of using version control when programming.  
After this breakthrough, I applied a similar approach to subsequent problems and found them significantly easier. I also went back and improved some of my solutions to earlier levels.  
I intend to continue playing SpaceChem both to fulfill the last of the extra criteria on Worksheet 1 and to improve my problem solving skills. I will use the game's metrics of cycles and symbols to compare my solutions and measure how my problem solving skills develop.

##Week 3

I am finding preparing for and getting started on the game platform essay difficult. Both essay writing and researching are new to me, so this assignment will serve as a learning experience. I have had difficulty keeping track of the sources I have found, so next time I will record which information I have found where whilst in the process of researching. I will measure this by assessing how regularly I find myself needing to go back and look up sources, after the next essay assignment.  
I also had trouble assessing the appropriateness of sources and knowing the situations in which it was appropriate to use non-academic sources, but I now have a clearer understanding after Friday's lecture.  

I haven't had any problems using JES so far, although it took me a little to get used to Python after having used other programming languages.

##Week 4
I have continued to struggle with writing the essay, particularly when it comes to developing an appropriate question and structuring a response. Advice on structure was given in Friday's lecture, but I will wait until after my personal tutor meeting before making any major changes.  

We were introduced to basic image manipulation using JES and set the Tinkering Graphics assignment. I have been having fun experimenting with image manipulation to try and yield interesting results. I was uncertain what was required for the Tinkering Graphics assignment initially, due to little guidance in the assignment brief, ambiguously worded contracts and being unsure about how to put pair programming into practice - but after many questions I have a slightly clearer idea now (except for the pair programming part). I will avoid this happening in future by writing a list of any questions I have and asking them at the soonest opportunity.  
I am also having difficulty planning/designing my program at this stage as I am not yet fully aware of all that is possible to do using JES.

##Week 5
I addressed many of the problems I was having and many of the questions I had in my personal tutor meeting at the beginning of the week, by writing a list of questions and emailing them beforehand. I now have a clearer understanding of the requirements and feel more confident to continue progressing with my assignments. This demonstrates that compiling a list of questions to ask is a helpful strategy for overcoming the obstacle of communication and asking for help.

I have started designing and thinking of ideas for the Tinkering Graphics project. I am considering using normal Python and the Python Imaging Library (PIL) rather than JES, for the added functionality and flexibility. I have been playing around with it and have managed to implement everything that I had learnt how to do in JES so far. Although it may slow down the project as it involves learning something new and more complex alongdside beginning development, I believe it will benefit me in the long run, as programmers are expected to be able to continuously learn new things in order to keep up with advances in technology. This continued learning itself is a skill.

We were also introduced to Agile development. I found the concept to be quite confusing and I am struggling to understand what a 'user story' is, particularly in relation to the Tinkering Graphics assignment. I asked for clarification and now have a slightly clearer understanding and managed to identify some user stories for my chosen contract.

I found performing a peer review of the essays difficult due to the subjective nature of it, even with the guidance of the marking scheme. It did however give the opportunity to think about the quality of your own and others' work.

##Week R
I have made a start with developing the program for the Tinkering Graphics assignment. This has involved looking up information about how to use the Python Imaging Library, as I have opted to not use JES. I sometimes struggled to understand what some things meant, but this will improve as I become more experienced. I will confront this by regularly reading the Python documentation and the documentation of other libraries and attempt to understand and use features in my code. I will measure the success of this by reviewing whether I managed to use some of the constructs detailed in the documentation in my project.

I have had some difficulty determining what types of comments I should write, and where comments are appropriate. I gained some insight by reading the chapter about comments in the Clean Code book, but some uncertainty remains. This can be developed by ensuring that I consistantly write comments in my code as I am writing it, and receive feedback on the appropriateness of the comments from the lecturer and my peers.

I have also begun to read about Kivy in the book on the reading list and the Pong tutorial. I am finding it quite confusing at the moment due to being unfamiliar with object oriented programming concepts.

I have had difficulty revising my essay and applying the finishing touches. This has partly been due to perfectionistic tendancies and struggling to limit the time I spent working on it. I will attempt to tackle this problem by allocating specific days/times to work on each assignment.

##Week 6
After perseverance, I have now begun to get my head around object oriented programming. I have managed to implement object oriented programming principles in my tinkering graphics project, and after doing so I am now starting to have a clearer understanding of its principles and how it works. It has made my code much more readable and manageable. Overall, I am happy with the progress I have made.  
I will continue to practice using object oriented principles in my programs to further my understanding and learn how to write better code. By ensuring that I use object oriented programming in each of my projects and receiving feedback on them, I will improve the quality of my programming.

The Tinkering Graphics project has also made me use problem solving skills. I have come across various problems that needed solving whilst writing my program. I have managed to solve them through reading, thinking and experimentation.

##Week 7
I have continued working on my Tinkering Graphics project. One difficulty I have found with object oriented programming is that I often find myself unsure about what type of things should be made into classes, and what fields/methods they should contain to best achieve encapsulation. I will continue to incorporate object oriented programming in my projects and seek feedback on how appropriate the structure is to gain a better feel for it.

Over the last couple of weeks I have learnt a lot through trying to solve problems in my programs and reading documentation. I have found that I enjoy programming and have spent a lot of time doing so.

I have found researching for the Computer Architecture Essay difficult. Again, it's because I feel overwhelmed by the number of articles to choose from. I have found it difficult understanding the papers also. In order to prevent the feeling of being overwhelmed when I actually start writing the essay, I must ensure that I record where I have read information, as detailed in Week 3.

##Week 8
I have begun work on the Tinkering Audio project. I am finding it more difficult than the Tinkering Graphics project, as I am less able to visualise what is happening when sound is being manipulated. With graphics, I am able to think of a desired effect and have a good idea how to go about implementing it, wheras with audio, this is not the case. I will research more into how audio works and the types of effects that can be produced this week, and attempt to implement particular waves or effects.

I have struggled with the Computer Architecture Essay, particularly when trying to fit both technical description alongside discussion and analysis into the 1000 word limit. I have attempted to only briefly describe the aspects of the algorithms without going into too much depth, whilst focusing on the analysis. Although, I am concerned that it now lacks technical detail. I have also found it difficult finding ways to include technical detail in the way that is expected, as I could not identify any specific pseudocode or algorithms in most of the papers about PCG.

I am still struggling to get my head around Kivy, despite having done the pong tutorial and read a few chapters of the book, as well as going through the documentation. 

##Week 9
After perseverence I have managed to understand Kivy a little more now. I have implemented a random maze generation algorithm into my Kivy app. I am finding problem solving in the context of a game a lot more difficult than with the Tinkering projects, due to the dynamic nature of it. Programming for games regularly and confronting problems directly will allow me to develop a better instinct for this style of coding and problem solving. In order to acheive this I will try to do some programming every day and see how often I find myself getting completely stuck and unable to solve a problem after a term of programming.

I have struggled to write the essay, but have managed to get something I am relatively happy with together without spending too much time going over it. I have made a conscious effort to focus on analysis during this essay, by allocating only one paragraph for description. I am still struggling to cut the word count down, however. I tried including figures in my essay as an attempt to reduce the word count, but I still need to do a lot of editing to bring it down enough. I am concerned that I will have to compromise on the analytical and discussive content of the essay in order to fit the limit, as I have already stripped down the description as much as possible.

I am finding the databases and client-server activities very confusing, due to never having encountered them before. I will tackle this by breaking the assignment down into small tasks and tackling one at a time. After each task, I should become more confident to complete the next one.

After having practiced object oriented programming with the Tinkering Audio and Kivy assignment, I am starting to understand the concept of encapsulation better.

##Week 10
I have continued focusing my work on the Architecture Essay the Kivy app project. 
After struggling a significant amount, I managed to bring the word count of the essay down to an acceptable level. In future essay assignments, I will use techniques such as including figures in the initial essay-writing process, in order to prevent the need for excessive editing later.

After Friday's additional session providing support for the client-server task, I feel in a more comfortable position to begin work on this project and have a better understanding of how to use MySQL. I will continue to develop my understanding by attempting to implement one or more of the algorithms required for Coding Task 1 during the Christmas Holidays.

##Week X1
I spent the majority of the time working on the Kivy App. Actively using the Trello board and planning sprints has developed my understanding for what user stories, requirements and tasks are.    
This has had the effect of increasing my productivity, motivation and project planning skills. By moving cards from the to-do list, 
I can see how much I have achieved. Following the sprint plans has also helped prevent me from getting distracted including additional features.  
I should continue this practice by creating Trello boards and sprint planning for other projects, to encourage me to manage my time more effectively. 

##Week X2
(It's short as I was unable to get much done this week or the rest of the Christmas holidays)  
I had a look at starting the client-server task, and managed to implement one of the required algorithms in a rough way. I now feel more confident about this assignment and have a relatively clear idea how I am going to do the rest of it.

I also spent time working on the Tinkering Audio project. I feel fairly confident about programming the required algorithms, but still find it difficult to create interesting sounds using my program. 

##Week 11
I have found reviewing peers' code difficult when the code to be reviewed is long and complex (I feel sorry for whoever has to review mine!). I am finding it hard to understand and read code that is written by others - this is a skill that will develop by continuing to review peers' code. It is important to develop this skill as it will be essential in the group collaboration projects. To develop this skill, I will regularly read and comment on peers' code on GitHub. I will measure how well I was able to comprehend the code by attempting to predict what it will do before running it. If I have understood the code, I should also be able to offer more useful comments.

##Week 12
I am finding writing the reflective report extremely difficult. This is because I am not used to writing in a personal style, and I am also reluctant to do so because of social anxiety. I find that I am good at self-reflection, as long as I don't need to tell anybody about it, be it in writing or verbally... I struggle to express personal things and find that I keep being tempted to write in an impersonal style in the report. I am also struggling to think of ways to measure SMART targets. 
I will try to improve the skill of reflection by thinking of SMART targets during this reflective report and gaining feedback on them.
